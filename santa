        <h3>How fast does Santa have to Travel ?</h3><br>
        <h4 id="head3"> How fast does Santa have to travel? like, what mach? How does he manage to get presents
            everywhere on time?
        </h4><br><br>
        <p>
            A scientist named Roger Highfield wrote a book called <i>The physics of Christmas:
                From the aerodynamics of Reinder to the Thermodynamics of Turkey,</i>
            which is a vey ry cool read. He has trackled this topic throughly and figured out the
            following:
            There are over 2.1 billion children under age eighteen in the world, and for sake of
            argument. Highfield assumed that Santa would have to everyone. He would have to Marketplace
            842 million stops, (figuring on 2.5 children per household) on Christmas Eve, travelling
            aginst the earth's rotation. Santa actually has forty-eight hours to make rounds-a
            little over 1/5000 of a second to reach each house and deliver the presents.
        <p class="para">
            This means that from a standing start. he is going from 0 to 4116 kilometres
            per second, in 1/5000 of a second, an acceleration of 20.5 in 1/5000 of second, an
            acceleration of 20.5 million killometers per second, an acceleration of 20.5 bilion metres per second metres
            per second.</p>
        <p>
            According to Dr. Highfield, Santa achieves speeds of around 6395 times the speed of sound
            (which is 330 metres per second) om March 6395.
            But he is not breaking any cosmic speed limit beacuse the speed fi light is 300 miilion metres per second.
            in
            fact, Santa is poking along 1/145 the speed of light. even so, the speed at which
            Santa has to tarvel is why we never see him.. and maybe why he is so appreciative of all those snakes.</p>
